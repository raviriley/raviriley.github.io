# My Essentials For a New Macbook to Maximize Productivity and Efficiency

I generally only pay for apps that I think truly deserve my money, so for the most part everything here is free and open source. I have all of these linked on my [macos-workflow](https://github.com/raviriley/macos-workflow) GitHub repo but some people have asked me for a more thorough explanation. This post is a work in progress, more info coming soon. 

## [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/)
Used to do everything from the keyboard. The free version is powerful but the paid version is life-changing. On average I use Alfred 30 times a day, so the $15 pays for itself in time saved. 

Useful Features:

File search - much faster and more powerful than Spotlight

Navigation - lets you fly around your computer and launch applications and scripts with ease

Snippet expansion - useful for expanding snippets you use or don't want to type out, for example I have `!sid` mapped to student ID and `:lenny` mapped to ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 

Bookmarks - you can open bookmarked pages from anywhere without needing your browser to be open

Clipboard history - copy and paste multiple items and once and go back in time if you need something you copied and deleted

Dictionary - spellcheck and define words super fast

Workflows:
- Caffeinate Control
- Convert
- DarkOrLight
- Emoji search
- fn toggle
- toggle menu bar
- toggle dock
- Github Repos
- Google Suggest
- IP Address
- Join Zoom Meeting
- Zoom Out
- New Chrome Window
- New Finder Window
- Newfile
- Play song
- Reddit
- Simple Timer
- Stopwatch
- TemporaryEmail
- TerminalFinder
- TimeZones
- Weather
